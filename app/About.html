        <p>We are a team who take action into helping families and nannies to find a safe, fun 
            and worthy connection between them, with the objective of transforming childrenâ€™s life 
            through love and respect. 
            
            As a digital platform we narrow bridges bringing child care professionals closer to 
            responsible parents, we radically simplify connections and preserve trust between 
            parties for giving children a caring environment for growing up.</p>
